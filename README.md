The main goal of this project is to discuss the design and implementation of the "Public Storage Proof" design and implementation

Public Storage Proof means a proof mechanism. The preserved data of the data can prove that it preserves a copy of a specific data by showing a small Proof of data.

This proof is a cryptography-based protocol. We hope that he can be used in various consensus structures and can become a basic agreement across multiple consensus architectures.

After determining the design, we will also complete the realization of the renovation project in the changing project

1. Solidity (Done)
2. BTC Script (TODO)
